            <h3>Description</h3>Use this dough recipe and the filling/toppings below to create 2 Homemade Strombolis. See all recipe notes before beginning because you can save half of the dough for another time or make other dishes with it (such as pizza or breadsticks). More filling suggestions, helpful step-by-step photos, and a video tutorial are included in the post.

          <h3>Ingredients</h3> <ul>
                                   <li>1 and 1/3 cups (320ml) warm water (between 100-110°F, 38-43°C)</li>
                                   <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons instant or active-dry yeast (1 standard packet)</li>
                                   <li>1 Tablespoon (13g) granulated sugar</li>
                                   <li>2 Tablespoons (30ml) olive oil</li>
                                   <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                                   <li>3 and 1/2 cups (438g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled), plus more for hands and work surface</li>
                              </ul>

          <h3>Steps</h3> <ol>
                             <li>Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes. *If you don’t have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula in the next step.</li>
                             <li>Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 3-4 minutes (for a visual, watch me do it in the video above!). The dough can be a little too heavy for a mixer to knead it, but you can certainly use the mixer on low speed instead. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger – if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.</li>
                             <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray– just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. If using instant yeast, this takes about 1 hour. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150°F (66°C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it’s doubled in size, remove from the oven.)</li>
                             <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (204°). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
                             <li>Shape the dough: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Divide in half. (If you aren’t making 2 strombolis, freeze the other half of dough. See freezing instructions below.) On a lightly floured work surface using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll each half of dough into a 10×16 inch rectangle. I like to use my hands to square off the edges, as shown in the video above. If the dough keeps shrinking as you try to shape it, cover it lightly and let the dough rest for 10 minutes before trying again. (The gluten just needs to settle.)</li>
                             <li>Add fillings: Mix melted butter and garlic together. Spread all over each rectangle. Sprinkle each with parsley. When you start layering on meats and cheeses, leave a 1 inch border on the bottom and sides and a 3 inch border on top. (Basically you’ll have an empty 3×16 inch gap on top that only has butter/garlic on it. This is because when rolling, the fillings will be pushed forward. See photos and video above if you need a visual.) Arrange a layer sliced meats onto each dough, usually about 8-10 slices on each depending on size and thickness of slices. Add a layer of cheese. Repeat with more meat and cheese until all is used– about 1/2 pound meat and 1/2 pound cheese per stromboli. Brush all edges with egg wash, including 3 inch gap at the top. This helps the stromboli hold its rolled shape. Slowly roll each into a tight 16 inch log, folding in the two ends as you roll. See me do this in the video above. Dust your hands or the dough with flour if things become too sticky. Carefully transfer each to lined baking sheets. Pinch or tuck in ends to seal if they became unfolded.</li>
                             <li>Brush each stromboli with egg wash and, if desired, optional toppings. Using a very sharp knife, cut 3-4 slits into the tops of each, which helps steam escape. At this point, you can cover shaped stromboli tightly and refrigerate for up to 8 hours.
                             <li>Bake for about 25 minutes or until crust is golden brown– if you have an instant read thermometer, the center of the stromboli should be at least 200ºF (93ºC). If meats are particularly greasy (like pepperoni), some grease will spill out the sides. Cheese may bubble out the sides or top slits, too. If baking both at the same time, rotate pans halfway through baking and extend bake time (if needed) by 2-3 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a cutting board and slicing.</li>
                             <li>Serve plain or with pizza/marinara sauce for dipping.</li>
                             <li>Cover and store leftover stromboli (slices or whole) in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
                        </ol>

            <h3>Description</h3>Did you ever wonder how artisan bakers make those super-buttery, flaky, light-as-air Danish? Here's how. Warning: this isn't a quick-and-easy recipe; there are numerous steps, including a suggested overnight rest for the dough. But if you follow the directions and take it one step at a time, you'll be able to claim a delicious new pastry for your baking repertoire.
            
      <h3>Ingredients</h3> <ul>
        <h6>Dough</h6>             <li>32 tablespoons (454g) unsalted butter, at cool room temperature, 65°F to 68°F</li>
                                   <li>5 1/2 cups (660g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
                                   <li>1/3 cup (67g) granulated sugar</li>
                                   <li>4 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
                                   <li>2 1/2 teaspoons (15g) salt, if you use salted butter, reduce this to 1 1/2 (9g) teaspoons salt</li>
                                   <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon cardamom, optional; for traditional flavor</li>
                                   <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                                   <li>1 cup (227g) milk, cold</li>
                                   <li>1/3 to 1/2 cup (76g to 113g) water, lukewarm</li>
                                   <li>2 large eggs</li>

        <h6>Cheese Filling</h6>    <li>half an 8-ounce package (113g) cream cheese</li>
                                   <li>1/2 cup (113g) cottage cheese or ricotta cheese</li>
                                   <li>3 tablespoons (35g) granulated sugar</li>
                                   <li>1 large egg</li>
                                   <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                                   
        <h6>Fruit Filling</h6>     <li>about 1 to 1 1/4 cups (298g to 369g) jam, preserves, or canned fruit pie filling</li>
                                   
        <h6>Topping</h6>           <li>1 large egg white, beaten lightly with 1 tablespoon cold water</li>
                                   
        <h6>Glaze</h6>             <li>1 1/2 cups (170g) confectioners' sugar or glazing sugar</li>
                                   <li>pinch of salt</li>
                                   <li>crushed nuts, optional; to garnish</li>
                              </ul>

                                 
          <h3>Steps</h3> <ol>
                             <li>Begin by cutting 1/4" butter off the end of each of the 4 sticks in the pound; you'll have about 2 tablespoons butter. Set them (and the remaining butter) aside. You'll be using the 2 tablespoons butter immediately, but won't need the remaining butter until after you've made the dough.</li>
                             <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and cardamom. Add the 2 tablespoons cold butter, working it in with your fingers until no large lumps remain. This step coats the flour a bit with fat, making the pastry a tiny bit more tender.</li>
                             <li>Add the vanilla, milk, water, and eggs. Mix and knead to make a cohesive, but quite sticky dough. This is easily done in a bread machine set on the dough cycle; or in a mixer. If you use a mixer, the dough won't completely clean the bowl; it'll probably leave a narrow ring around the side, and stick at the bottom.</li>
                             <li>Scrape the dough into a ball, and transfer it to a floured work surface. Cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rest for 10 minutes while you prepare the butter.</li>
                             <li>Cut each stick of butter in half lengthwise, to make 8 long rectangles. On a piece of floured parchment or plastic wrap, line up 4 of the butter pieces side by side, to form a rectangle. Sprinkle lightly with flour, and cover with another piece of parchment or plastic wrap.</li>
                             <li>Gently pound and roll the butter until it's about 6" x 9". The pieces may or may not meld together. If they do, great, they'll be easier to work with. If not, though, that's OK; don't stress about it.</li>
                             <li>Repeat with the remaining 4 pieces of butter. You should now have two butter rectangles, about 6" x 9" each.</li>
                             <li>Roll the dough into a rectangle about 12" wide and 24" long. Don't worry about being ultra-precise; this is just a guide, though you should try to get fairly close.</li>
                             <li>Place one of the butter pieces onto the center third of the dough. Fold one side over the butter to cover it. Place the other butter piece atop the folded-over dough, and fold the remaining dough up over it. You now have a rectangular "packet" of dough-enclosed butter. Pinch the open ends and side closed as best you can.</li>
                             <li>Turn the dough 90°, so a 12" side is closest to you. Roll the dough into a 10" x 24" rectangle (approximately). Fold each side into the center; then fold one side over the other to make a rectangular packet about 6" x 10".</li>
                             <li>Dust the surface of the dough with flour, wrap it in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.</li>
                             <li>Remove the dough from the fridge, and again roll it into a rectangle about 10" x 24". Fold it into a packet as you did in step #10; it'll be about 7" x 12". Roll one final time, fold into a packet, and flour the dough lightly. Wrap loosely (but completely) in plastic, and chill it for 2 hours, or up to 16 hours; we prefer the longer refrigeration, as it gives the dough a chance to relax and rise.</li>
                             <li>Before shaping the pastries, select your filling(s). We like to use a variety. Either of the filling suggestions in this recipe make enough to fill all the pastries; so if you want to mix and match, make a half-recipe of the cheese filling, and use only half the amount of fruit filling called for.</li>
                             <li>To make the cheese filling, combine all of the ingredients, stirring until smooth. For the smoothest filling, process in a food processor.</li>
                             <li>When you're ready to make pastries, remove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap it, and cut off one-third. You'll work with this piece first; return the remainder to the fridge.</li>
                             <li>Divide the dough into 12 pieces. Roll each into a smooth ball, then flatten the balls into 3" to 3 1/2" rounds, making the center thinner than the edges. You want to build up a slight wall of dough all around the circumference; this will help hold the filling. Place the rounds on a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet.</li>
                             <li>Working with one-half of the remaining dough at a time, repeat the process; you'll finish with three baking sheets, each with 12 dough rounds.</li>
                             <li>Cover the Danish lightly with greased plastic wrap, and let them rise for about 1 hour; they'll become slightly puffy. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>
                             <li>Use your fingers to press the centers of the dough rounds as flat as possible, leaving the "sidewalls" puffed. Spoon a slightly heaping measuring teaspoon of filling into the well of each round.</li>
                             <li>Brush the exposed edges of pastry with the egg/water topping; this will create a satiny, golden crust.</li>
                             <li>Bake the pastries for 15 to 18 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and transfer to a rack. Glaze and serve immediately; or wait until they cool, then glaze.</li>
                             <Li>To make the glaze, whisk the confectioners' sugar and salt with enough water or milk to make a "drizzle-able" glaze.</Li>
                             <li>Drizzle the glaze atop the pastries. Sprinkle with crushed nuts.</li>
                        </ol>
                             
    
      <h1>Grilled Steak</h1>

        <img>src=https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/VLGfGCuAPPNZ_tpgXxxEGEa9l8c=/648x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__simply_recipes__uploads__2018__06__Grilled-Steak-LEAD-4-b30864603691437aaff6d9b883db56c2.jpg
          <h3>Description</h3>This sauce goes well with any steak; you can also skip it or use a different sauce.
        I prefer to cook thicker steaks and share them rather than smaller, thinner individual steaks. If you are a grilling novice, thicker steaks are also a little more forgiving.
        In this recipe, I’m aiming for medium to medium rare. Ribeyes have lots of marbling, and I want that to break down; cooking it to rare wouldn’t accomplish that goal on a grill.
          
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>        <ul>
            <h5>For the steak</h5> <li>1 1/2-inch thick ribeye, bone in or out (about 1 1/2 pounds without the bone)</li>
                                   <li>3/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt or kosher salt</li>
                                   <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
          
            <h5>For the sauce</h5> <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
                                   <li>Leaves from 4 sprigs of thyme</li>
                                   <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary</li>
                                   <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                                   <li>1 shallot, about half the size of a golf ball, minced</li>
                              </ul> 
          
            
   <h3>Steps</h3>              <ol>
      <h4>Trim fat</h4>            <li>Remove the outer layer of fat from the ribeye. The interior marbling will flavor the meat, whereas the outer fat layer will produce flare ups on the grill, which can add a burnt (not charred) flavor to the steak.</li>
      
      <h4>Season; refrigerate</h4> <li>Pat the steak dry with a paper towel. This removes surface moisture and will help you achieve a good sear.
Season each side with salt and pepper and rub them in a bit. Put the steak in the fridge, uncovered, for at least an hour and up to 48 hours.</li>
  
      <h4>Make herbed butter</h4>  <li>In a small saucepan, add butter, herbs, garlic, and shallots. Melt over low heat. Do this at least 10 minutes before you are ready to put the steak on the grill. The longer the herbs sit in the butter, the longer the flavors will infuse.
You can also make this butter up to 2 hours beforehand; if so, cover and refrigerate. Gently reheat the butter to melt it again before you put the steaks on the grill.</li>
      
      <h4>Preheat the grill</h4>   <li>Prepare a charcoal grill for two-zone grilling, so half is hot and one half is warm. The grill is hot when you can only hold your hand over the hot zone for a second or two.
On a gas grill, heat the grill to 450°F with two burners going, which should only take about 10 minutes, then turn one of the burners down to medium to create two cooking zones.</li>

      <h4>Cook & baste steak</h4>  <li>Add the steak to the hottest side of the grill. Close the lid and sear for 2 minutes. Open the lid, flip the steak, and baste it with the melted herb butter and herbs. Close the lid. Cook for 2 additional minutes.
Flip the steak again and move it to a lower heat side. Baste it again with butter. Continue flipping and basting every two minutes for the next 6 minutes, closing the lid between each flip.
        After the steak has been on the grill for a total of 10 minutes (for medium-rare steak), transfer it to a clean platter; it should read 137°F to 140°F internally. Baste it again with butter. (Continue cooking for longer if you prefer your steak more well-done.)</li>
      
      <h4>Let steak rest</h4>      <li>Let it rest for 5 minutes; it will climb another few degrees as it sits and the juices will redistribute.</li>

      <h4>Slice & serve</h4>       <li>Slice the steak against the grain. Pour any remaining herb butter sauce over top and serve.</li>
                              </ol>
